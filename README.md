# Tripsit Factsheets

A nodejs-based web app which organises data from [TripSit's](https://tripsit.me/) database of drug information into 
factsheets for general use. See [here](http://drugs.tripsit.me/) for a working example.

## Installation and Usage

Simply pull the repo to begin. Dependencies include nodejs and npm.


Install with `npm install` and run with `npm start run`.


The repo will initially download and cache data from TripSit and periodically check for updates. The app runs on port 5001 by 
default.
